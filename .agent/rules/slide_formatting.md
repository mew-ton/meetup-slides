# Slide Formatting Rules

These rules are extracted from `.agent/workflows/create_monthly_slides.md` and MUST be followed when creating or editing slides.

## Section Titles

- **Title Slide Header**: MUST be `## [Specific Tool/Service Name]`.
    - **Constraint**: Must be the concrete name of the technology (e.g., `## Tailwind CSS`).
    - **Prohibited**: Do not include "News", "Update", or descriptive titles in the header (e.g., `## Tailwind CSS News` is INVALID).
- **Sub-slides**:
    - "What is...": `## "[Name]" とは`
    - "News": `## [Name] のニュース`

## Structure

1. **Title Slide**: Technology Name + Date.
2. **Definition**: "What is..." (3 lines).
3. **News**: What happened.
4. **Details**: Background/Context.
